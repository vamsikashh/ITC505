                    <h2>My Journey into Photography</h2>
                    <p>Photography has been a passion of mine since childhood. It all started when my father gave me his old film camera. I remember capturing my first sunset and being mesmerized by how a simple click could freeze a moment in time.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, my interest evolved from amateur snapshots to studying light, composition, and techniques. Each click of the shutter became an opportunity to tell a story or evoke an emotion.</p>
                    <p>Today, I explore both digital and film photography, finding beauty in landscapes, portraits, and street scenes. Photography has not only enriched my travels but also taught me to see the world through a different lens.</p>
                    <div class="full-content">
                        <p>Photography has been a lifelong journey for me. From my first film camera to embracing digital photography, each moment captured tells a unique story. Whether it's the play of light in landscapes or the candid expressions in portraits, photography allows me to share my perspective with the world.</p>
                        <p>Through my blog, I aim to inspire others to see beauty in everyday moments and explore their creativity through photography.</p>
